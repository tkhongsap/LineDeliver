# "Load Sample Data" Feature Documentation

## **Purpose & Overview**

The "Load Sample Data" button is a **development and testing utility** that allows users to quickly populate the system with realistic sample customer data without needing to upload an actual CSV file.

## **How It Works**

### **When You Click "Load Sample Data":**

1. **Instant Data Generation**: The system creates 3 sample customer records with realistic Thai customer data
2. **Bypasses File Upload**: No file processing or validation - data is loaded directly into memory
3. **Activates Customer Records Tab**: Automatically enables and switches to the "Customer Records" tab
4. **Populates Table**: Sample data appears in the customer management table


### **Sample Data Structure**

```javascript
// 3 records are created with this structure:
{
  user_id: "U1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p",     // Valid LINE User ID
  order_no: "ORD-2024-0001",                          // Order number
  delivery_date: "2024-01-22",                        // Delivery date
  customer_name: "สมชาย ใจดี",                        // Thai customer name
  phone: "0812345678",                                 // Thai phone number
  address: "123 หมู่ 1 ตำบลบางกะปิ อำเภอเมือง...",    // Thai address
  notes: "โทรก่อนส่ง"                                  // Delivery notes
}
```

## **What Happens in the App**

### **Step-by-Step Flow:**

1. **Button Click** → User clicks "Load Sample Data" button
2. **Data Creation** → System generates 3 sample records instantly

2. Record 2: **"Ready"** status (green badge)
3. Record 3: **"Invalid"** status (red badge) - for testing error handling

## ️ **Important Notes**

### **Development Tool Only:**

- This button is primarily for **development and testing**
- In production, it could be **hidden or removed** for regular users
- **Not meant for real customer data processing**


### **Data Persistence:**

- Sample data exists **only in browser memory**
- **Refreshing the page** will clear the sample data
- **Not saved to database** - purely for testing UI functionality


### **Security Considerations:**

- Sample data uses **fake LINE User IDs**
- **No real customer information** is involved
- Safe for **training and demonstration** purposes
