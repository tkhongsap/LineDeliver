Let me explore the codebase to understand the current data storage and display patterns, identify where mockup/test data exists, and then propose plans to remove it while maintaining all functionality.

I'll start by examining the structure of the codebase and then look for patterns of mock data usage.

Now let me examine the specific mock data initialization methods and look at the database configuration:

Read file: /home/runner/workspace/drizzle.config.ts
Now let me check if there's already a database implementation and examine the current server setup:

Let me examine the server directory structure and look for any existing database implementation:

Read file: /home/runner/workspace/package.json
Let me continue reading the package.json to see the database-related dependencies:

Now let me check if there are any existing database migrations or PostgreSQL implementations:

Now let me check the shared schema files to understand the complete data model:

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me create a structured plan for removing mock data:

<FINAL_ANSWER>

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I understand how data is currently stored and displayed. Here's what I found:

## Current Data Storage Architecture

**Storage Pattern**: The application uses an interface-based storage pattern (`IStorage`) with an in-memory implementation (`MemStorage`) that contains hardcoded mock data.

**Mock Data Locations**:
1. **Delivery Data**: `initializeSampleData()` - 4 sample Thai delivery records
2. **Customer Records**: `initializeCustomerSampleData()` - 3 sample Thai customer records  
3. **Message Templates**: `initializeMessageTemplates()` - 1 default LINE message template

**Database Setup**: 
- PostgreSQL schemas are defined using Drizzle ORM
- Database connection configured but not implemented
- All dependencies are installed (@neondatabase/serverless, drizzle-orm, etc.)

## Implementation Plans

### **Plan A: Clean Slate Approach (RECOMMENDED)**
**Strategy**: Remove all mock data initialization and start with empty data stores.

**Pros**:
- Cleanest implementation
- No residual test data
- Forces proper testing with real data
- Minimal code changes

**Implementation**:
1. Remove all mock data initialization methods
2. Start with empty Maps in MemStorage constructor  
3. Keep the interface intact for future database migration
4. Add environment flag to optionally enable sample data for development

**Changes Required**:
- Modify `MemStorage` constructor in `server/storage.ts`
- Remove: `initializeSampleData()`, `initializeCustomerSampleData()`, `initializeMessageTemplates()`
- Frontend will show empty states initially

### **Plan B: Database Migration Approach**  
**Strategy**: Implement PostgreSQL database and remove in-memory storage entirely.

**Pros**:
- Production-ready solution
- Proper data persistence
- Scalable architecture
- No mock data concerns

**Implementation**:
1. Create database implementation class
2. Set up Drizzle migrations
3. Replace MemStorage with DatabaseStorage
4. Configure DATABASE_URL environment variable

**Changes Required**:
- Create new `DatabaseStorage` class implementing `IStorage`
- Generate and run database migrations
- Update storage instantiation in `server/storage.ts`
- Configure database connection

### **Plan C: Hybrid Approach**
**Strategy**: Keep MemStorage but make mock data optional via environment variable.

**Pros**:
- Maintains development flexibility
- Easy to toggle between modes
- Gradual transition possible

**Implementation**:
1. Add `ENABLE_SAMPLE_DATA` environment variable
2. Conditionally initialize mock data based on environment
3. Default to no sample data in production

**Changes Required**:
- Add environment variable check in constructor
- Modify initialization logic
- Update documentation

## **My Recommendation: Plan A (Clean Slate)**

I recommend **Plan A** because:

1. **Simplicity**: Minimal code changes with maximum impact
2. **Testing**: Forces you to test with real data immediately  
3. **Clean Architecture**: Maintains the excellent interface pattern for future database migration
4. **No Side Effects**: Eliminates any chance of mock data contaminating real data

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Remove mock data initialization methods
2. Start with empty data stores
3. Add optional development sample data flag
4. Test all functionality with real uploaded data

Would you like me to proceed with **Plan A**, or would you prefer one of the other approaches? I can implement whichever plan you think best fits your needs.
