## 1. Introduction/Overview

The LINE OA Delivery Dashboard requires significant enhancements to its customer records management system and dashboard functionality. This upgrade will transform the current basic delivery tracking system into a comprehensive customer communication management platform that enables efficient processing of daily delivery confirmations, bulk customer record management, and automated LINE message broadcasting.

**Core Problem**: The current system lacks the robust customer data management capabilities needed for large-scale delivery operations, resulting in manual processing bottlenecks, data validation errors, and inconsistent customer communications.

**Goal**: Create an enterprise-grade customer records management system with advanced dashboard features that streamlines delivery confirmations, ensures data quality, and provides comprehensive operational oversight through an intuitive web interface.

## 2. Goals

1. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce manual processing time by 70% through automated data validation and bulk editing capabilities
2. **Data Quality**: Achieve 95% successful message delivery rate through enhanced data validation and real-time error detection
3. **User Experience**: Provide intuitive dashboard interface with comprehensive search, filtering, and pagination capabilities
4. **Message Management**: Enable preview and bulk broadcasting of standardized LINE messages with template variable substitution
5. **Scalability**: Support processing of 1,000+ daily delivery records with responsive performance
6. **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete record of all customer data modifications and message broadcasts

## 14. Open Questions

1. **LINE API Integration Timeline**: When should we implement actual LINE message broadcasting vs. simulation?
2. **Database Migration**: Should we migrate from in-memory storage to PostgreSQL immediately or phase it?
3. **User Authentication**: Future requirement for user roles and permissions management?
4. **Backup Strategy**: How should customer data be backed up beyond database-level backups?
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Need for APM tools or built-in Replit monitoring sufficient?
6. **Message Templates**: Should we support custom message templates or standardized templates only?
7. **Audit Logging**: Level of detail required for customer record modification tracking?
8. **Error Recovery**: Automated retry mechanisms for failed operations or manual intervention preferred?

**Next Steps**: Review this PRD with stakeholders, address open questions, and proceed with implementation planning once approved.
